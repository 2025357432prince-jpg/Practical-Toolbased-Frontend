🖼️ Task 2: Add an Image with Alt Text
Task 2 focuses on using HTML and CSS to display an image with proper formatting. You create task2.html with an <h2> heading ("My Favorite Place"), an <img> tag (using src and alt attributes), and a descriptive <p> below it. Using CSS, you must set the image width to 300px, center the image on the page, and add a 20px top margin to the paragraph for layout.
















➕ Task 6: Add Two Numbers and Show Result
Task 6 involves basic JavaScript for calculations and displaying results. First, create task6.html with an <h1> heading ("Addition Result") and an empty <p id="result"> element in the body. In the JavaScript section, you declare two variables (e.g., a = 5, b = 10), calculate their sum into a sum variable, and then use document.getElementById("result").innerHTML to display the result string on the page.
